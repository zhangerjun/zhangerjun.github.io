Hi,welcome to my page!

Here is something about me. Now I am a PhD student at Polytechnique Montreal, studying Biomedical Engineering, under supervison of Prof. Benjamin De Leener (Poly) and Prof. Gregory A. Lodygensky (co-supervisor, UdeM). Before that, I studied optical engineering in Shenzhen University (2010-2014), in Beijing University of Technology (2015-2018) in China. After that I studied teraherz imaging and "samrt windows" for one year in Prof. Skorogbogaty's (Poly) group. 

My research topic is "Diffusion MRI", especially for children brain mapping. I am also intreasted in methords that can be used in MR imaging, such as machine learning and deep learning. Welcome all of you contact me about reseach, topics about MRI as well as coding skills.

Now,I am learning oral and wrting English and some basic French. Anyone, who are keen on language learning, either English or French, can also contact me. I am happy to study with you!
