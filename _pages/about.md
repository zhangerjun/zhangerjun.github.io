Hi,welcome to my page!

Here is something about me. Now I am a PhD student in Polytechnique Montreal, studying Biomedical Engineering, under supervison of Prof. Benjamin De Leener (Poly) and Prof. Gregory A. Lodygensky (UdeM). My research topic is "Diffusion MRI", especially for children brain mapping. I am also intreasted in methord that can be used in MR imaging, such as machine learning and deep learning. 

Before that, I studied optical engineering in Shenzhen University (2010-2014), in Beijing University of Technology (2015-2018) in China. After that I also studied teraherz imaging for one year in Prof. Skorogbogaty's (Poly) group.
